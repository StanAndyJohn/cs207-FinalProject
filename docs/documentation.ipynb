    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The premise of this project relies on the question - \"Why are derivatives important?\". Derivatives are used to explain the instantaneous rate of change and is a building block in the mathematics behind optimization problems. They are a fundamental tool of calculus. Since real world problems are continuous and seldomly neatly segmented into discrete blocks, we need derivatives to help us understand the patterns that we see occurring in the real world. This can range from applications in the field of medicine to that of rocket science. The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation and is a fundamental operation in the field of calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we learn differentiation by hand, more complex equations require us to use computers to compute the results.Automatic Differentiation is a way for computers to break down the steps required to compute the derivative of a function. Computers no matter their level of processing power, all have a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations and elementary functions that can be put together via the chain rule to calculate complex, higher-order tasks. Our software library will take in these complex, higher-order tasks and produce accurate results via Automatic Differentiation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another method that computers use to compute derivatives is Symbolic Differentiation. Symbolic Differentiation requires complete knowledge of all control flow in the program and can get exponentially large which results in a slow-down of the system when computing complex workloads. We choose to focus on the Automatic Differentiation implementation in this project because of this reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are building a software library to allow users to utilize Automatic Differentiation methods on machine calculations in order to guarantee the precision and accuracy of their calculations (this is particularly useful in scientific computing scenarios). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "#### What is AD?\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, computers are able to compute elementary arithmetic operations and functions extremely well. When a computer is tasked with a derivative equation however, they can end up utilizing step sizes for limit operation that are too big or too small. When this occurs, the delta between the approximation and the actual value can vary significantly and randomly. In most computing scenarios, and especially scientific ones, accuracy is required and non-negotiable. Therefore, we turn to automatic differentiation to save the day. AD utilizes the simple chain rule - that the derivative of each sub-expression can be calculated recursively to obtain the final derivatives - to overcome the problem of inaccuracy that computers are presented with.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why AD?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three kinds of differentiation: Numerical Differentiation, Symbolic Differentiation, and Automatic Differentiation. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Numerical Differentiation_ works by estimating the derivative of a mathematical function using values of the function and is done by completing finite difference approximations. This way of calculating a derivative requires a lot of computation when faced with a high-dimensional function and therefore cannot scale into more complex endeavors.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Symbolic Differentiation* utilizes the product rule and the chain rule to restructure the original function into a simplified expression that can be handled by the computer for more efficient calculations. Symbolic Differentiation requires access to and transformation of source code. It can be expensive to build and performs redundant computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Automatic Differentiation* also uses the chain rule but does so by breaking components of the function down into elementary functions that can be computed with high accuracy and speed allowing for better utilization of computing resources in application. This method is simple to implement and verify. It is also easy to use while producing accurate results at the level that Symbolic Differentiation produces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Derivatives\n",
    "The derivative of a function measures the sensitivity of the function output with respect to its input value. The derivative is often described as the 'instantaneous rate of change'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f'(a)=\\lim _{h\\to 0}{\\frac {f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chain Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule allows us to break down the computation of a derivative of an object comprised of two or more functions as can be seen in the example below. It is a fundamental building block towards understanding how Automatic Differentation works.\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\frac  {dz}{dx}}={\\frac  {dz}{dy}}\\cdot {\\frac  {dy}{dx}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does AD work?\n",
    "An example of how AD works is provided below using the chain rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "y=f(g(h(x)))=f(g(H(w_{0})))=f(g(w_{1}))=f(w_{2})=w_{3}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "w_{0}=x\\\\\n",
    "w_{1}=h(w_{0})\\\\\n",
    "w_{2}=g(w_{1})\\\\\n",
    "w_{3}=f(w_{2})=y\\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial{y}}{\\partial{x}} = \\frac{\\partial{y}}{\\partial{w_{2}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial{w_{2}}}{\\partial{w_{1}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial{w_{1}}}{ \\partial{x}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward mode states that goes from the inside to the outside, while reverse mode is from the outside to the inside. In the case above:\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward mode calculates: $\\frac{\\partial{w_{i}}}{\\partial{x}} = \\frac{\\partial{w_{i}}}{\\partial{w_{i-1}}}\\cdot \\frac{\\partial{w_{i-1}}}{\\partial{x}}$ and $w_3 = y$\n",
    "\n",
    "Reverse mode calculates: $\\frac{\\partial{y}}{\\partial{w_{i}}} = \\frac{\\partial{y}}{\\partial{w_{i+1}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial{w_{i+1}}}{\\partial{w_{i}}}$ and $w_{0} = x$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward and Reverse Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "_Forward Mode_\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward mode applies the chain rule to each basic operation in a forward trace - at every stage it will evaluate the operater as well as the gradient in lockstep. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Reverse Mode_\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two phases in reverse mode: the forward phase and the backward phase. During the forward phase, all intermediate variables are evaluated and the results are stored in memory. In the backward phase, the chain rule is utilized to propagate back the derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Elementary Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Elementary functions are defined as funtioncs of one variable which is a finite sum, product, and/or composition of rational functions, sin, cos, exp, and their inverse functions. We've listed a sample of elementary functions and their corresponding derivatives in the table below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|$$f(x)$$ |\t$$f'(x)$$\n",
    "| :- |:-|\n",
    "|$$c$$|\t$0$|\n",

    "|$$\\tan(x)$$|$$\\frac{1}{\\cos^2x}$$|\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jacobians \n",
    "The Jacobian matrix of a vector-valued function is the matrix of all of its first-order partial derivatives as can be seen in the matrix representation below. If the Jacobian matrix is a square matrix, it is known as the Jacobian determinant.\n",
    "<img src=\"./pictures/Figure4.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computational Graph Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational graph representation allows us to visualize how the computer is breaking down the calculations into the fundamental steps we described above. For example, in lecture, we took the following equation and broke it down into the respective steps for calculation. The graph can be viewed as a flowchart and is easier for the viewer to understand how the elementary functions operate on each variable in the process.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Root Finding\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Background*: Newton’s Method is a root-finding algorithm that produces successively better approximations to the roots of a function. The idea is to start with an initial guess which is reasonably close to the true root, then to approximate the function by its tangent line using calculus, and finally to compute the x-intercept of this tangent line by elementary algebra. At each step t of the process, Newton’s Method finds a line that is tangent to the function at point x(t). Where the tangent line crosses the x-axis serves as the new guess for x(t+1). Newton’s Method can be used to find a minimum or maximum of a function and is also a very efficient way to find the multiplicative inverses of numbers and power series.\n",
